# Point3D Class
 
## Overview
 
This assignment involves the function declaration in a class named `Point3D` in the `Point3D.h` file. The class is designed to represent a point in three-dimensional space.
 
## Class Definition
 
1. **Class File:**
   - Class Declaration: `Point3D.h`
   - Class Defination: `Point3D.cpp`
 
2. **Constructor:**
   - Write a constructor for `Point3D` that takes three double variables as arguments.
   - Initializes member variables with the provided argument values.
 
3. **Getters:**
   - Add member functions (getters) to the class to display the member variables of the class.
   - Example: `x()` displays the x value of the `Point3D` object.
 
## Test Program
 
1. **Test Program File:**
   - Test Program: `triangle.cpp`
 
2. **Usage:**
   - The test program creates an object of the `Point3D` class.
   - Calls the member function to display (p1, p2, p3) values of the created triangle.
