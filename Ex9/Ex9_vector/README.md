## Overview
 
This assignment involves use of sequential container vector.
 
## Function Definition
 
1. **Function File:**

-Function Definition: 'Reader.cpp' file Reader class object reads the file.

-The file provided is .stl file so the reader reads data of triangles present in the .stl file and stores in the vector of triangles of class triangulation.

-In 'Writer.cpp' file "void Writer::write(std::string filePath ,std::vector<Triangle>& triangles)" function writes Points in the file given as an argument.

2. **Usage:**

-The program reads .stl file and returns the points of triangles in the .txt file.
-Reader reads the .stl file and writer writes in the .txt file.
